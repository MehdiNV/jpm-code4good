Our aim in this project was to engage users better and streamline the resources usually needed for conducting a longitudinal study. Through our work, we were able to deliver a website that gamified research in the hopes of retaining participant engagement over long periods of time, whilst making a platform for research that is portable and easy for data extraction.
